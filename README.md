# Trip Weather Outlook

## User Story
AS A traveler<br>
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities<br>
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly<br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs<br>
WHEN I search for a city<br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history<br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index<br>
WHEN I view the UV index<br>
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe<br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity<br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history<br>
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.<br>

This was a bit of a challenge for me, I had my tutor and a TA helping out with getting this right.<br>
I hide the current weather and five day forecast jumbotrons to give the site a cleaner look without having a city searched. Once you search for a city you should get its current weather and five day forecast. The city name should then saves to a list, that you can click on to to change to different cities .<br>
The biggest hurdle I had was getting the five day forecast dates right. It just couldn't be as simple as the current weather one.
